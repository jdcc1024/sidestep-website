# Issue: Relabel / Remove Design on the Roster

## Status: done

## Phase: 2

## Type: feature

## Vertical Slice
This issue touches:
- [ ] Database: none (reads `rosterEntries` / `orderEntries`)
- [x] API: removing a design from an order computes affected submitters + flags its entries removed (dropped from count); relabel carries entries over
- [x] Frontend: non-destructive warning naming affected submitters; "removed" indicator on flagged entries
- [x] Tests: relabel keeps entries; remove flags + drops-from-count + returns affected submitters

## Description
Make edit-after-collection safe. **Relabelling** a design (renaming it) carries its roster + order entries over untouched, since they point by `designId`. **Removing** a design from an order doesn't delete data: its entries stay visible, are flagged "removed", and **drop out of the production count**, while the action surfaces a warning that **names the affected submitters**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Relabelling a design preserves all its roster + order entries and their counts
- [x] Removing a design returns the list of affected submitters (non-destructive)
- [x] Removed-design entries stay visible with a clear "removed" indicator rather than disappearing
- [x] Removed-design order entries are excluded from the derived total (R-04)
- [x] The remove action is a resolvable soft warning, never a silent hard stop
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] No regressions in existing tests

## Implementation
Two read queries in `convex/orderEntries.ts`, mirroring R-04's query-only
shape (the order-page warning/indicator rendering is order-page issue O-08,
which consumes these):

- `affectedByDesignRemoval({ runId, designId })` — the pre-removal preview:
  who ordered the design and how many jerseys would drop from the count.
  Design-agnostic (works whether the design is still linked or already
  removed) since it reads order entries by `designId`. Powers the soft,
  resolvable warning — it's a query, so removal itself (dropping the id from
  `order.designIds` via `orders.updateOrder`) is never blocked.
- `removedDesigns({ runId })` — every design that still has order entries but
  is no longer in `order.designIds`, each with affected submitters and
  dropped-jersey count, so removed entries stay visible flagged "removed".

Both reuse a `summarizeDesignSubmitters` helper (Σ qty grouped by normalized
email, sorted by name). "Removed" is the **derived state** decided in R-04 (a
design no longer in `order.designIds`) — no schema change, no per-entry flag,
no data deleted; the rows simply fall out of `countsByRun` while staying
readable here. **Relabel** is a no-op on entry data (entries key off
`designId`), verified by a test that renames a design and confirms entries +
counts carry over untouched.

## Dependencies
- Blocked by: R-02, R-04
- Blocks: R-07
- Blocks (EXTERNAL): O-08 (Relabel / Remove Design Warning) consumes this

## PRD Reference
See: docs/prd/roster-manager-and-lock.md — Section 4 (P1 relabel/remove), Section 6 (relabel, remove)

## Implementation Notes
- Relabel is mostly a no-op on entry data (they reference `designId`); the work is the warning + removed-flag plumbing on remove.
- "Removed" can be a derived state (design no longer in `orders.designIds`) rather than a stored flag on each entry — confirm which is cleaner during implementation.
- Keep copy warm and field-anchored (flow-spec §7) — name who picked the removed design.

## TDD Approach
1. Write test: relabel moves nothing/loses nothing; remove returns affected-submitter list, flags entries, and they fall out of the R-04 total.
2. Implement: relabel/remove handlers + warning UI + removed indicator.
3. Verify: counts reconcile before/after; no rows deleted.
