// Public surface of the jersey-run lib. Re-exports the atomic rules
// (constants, type guards, pure helpers) and the form adapter
// (validateJerseyRun, toJerseyRunPayload, JerseyRunErrors) so existing
// consumers can keep importing from "@/lib/jerseyRun" while the Convex
// side imports from "@/lib/jerseyRun/rules" directly.
